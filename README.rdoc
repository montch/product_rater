== Product_rater

My wife got me a 20 pack of cologne samples. Each day I would wear a new cologne and ask her for a rating between 1 and 10. I wanted a way to keep track of the rating for each one.  Its a pretty simple rails app that I could deploy to Heroku.

Yves saint laurent and Lacoste white won, they smell pretty good.
